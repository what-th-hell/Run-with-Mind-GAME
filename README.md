# Run-with-Mind-GAME
Run with Mind is a 2D maze game written in C++. In this game, you control a player in a colorful maze. Your goal is to collect powerups, avoid enemies, and reach the exit while keeping track of your score and moves.

How It Works
Maze: The game displays a 20x20 maze. Walls are shown using different characters (like # and @) with colors to make them stand out.

Player: You control the player using the W, A, S, and D keys to move up, left, down, and right. The player is displayed as a P.

Enemies: Enemies, shown as X, chase you every time you make a move. If an enemy touches you, the game ends.

Powerups: Collect powerups (displayed as \*). Each powerup increases your score.

Exit: The exit is marked with the letter E. Reach the exit to complete the level.

Levels: There are two levels. The first level is easier, while the second level is more challenging with more walls and more enemies.

Score and Moves: The game keeps track of your score and the total number of moves you make.

Save/Load: You can save your game progress to a file and load it later.

Guaranteed Path: A safe corridor is always carved into the maze so that you have a clear path from the start to the exit.
